# Local Spaces

Local spaces is a simple Flask application to show a list of hackspaces, within a defined radius, and show their current status. This was designed to use be used on a rotating dashboard within Leigh Hackspace, and show that the hackspace scene exists outside of the walls of the hackspace they're in.

This app makes use of the [SpaceAPI](https://spaceapi.io).
